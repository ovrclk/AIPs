## Summary

Launch Testnet with a fully functioning spot computing marketplace for containers and serverless deployment platform as proposed in the [DCS-2](/spec/dcs-2). Incentivize user adoption of by applying game mechanics.

## Motivation

Akash is a decentralized system. Meaning, upon launch, the project team will have little control to address critical issues with regards to scalability, security, and usability.

Testing the system in the real world using a series of Testnets provides the project team with data to identify critical issues and limits of the network ahead of time.

## Rationale

Decentralized Computing is a novel concept that mandates user behavior change to realize value. By incentivizing adoption by applying game mechanics, we can achieve meaningful adoption while educating the user.

  - [DCS-2: Decentralized Cloud Exchange](/spec/dcs-2)
